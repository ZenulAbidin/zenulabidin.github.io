                There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture originated the term â€˜hackerâ€™.
                Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you&apos;re a hacker.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics or music â€” actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred
                spirits elsewhere and may call them â€˜hackersâ€™ too â€” and some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the hacker works in. But in the rest of this document we will focus on the skills and attitudes of software hackers, and the traditions
                of the shared culture that originated the term â€˜hackerâ€™.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren&apos;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people â€˜crackersâ€™ and want nothing to do with
                them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn&apos;t make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers
                have been fooled into using the word â€˜hackerâ€™ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them. (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is">Source</a>)

            </Col>
          </Row>
          <p className="text-center">Crackers are people who shamelessly use the word hacker to promote their illegal activities and malware. Many of them are actually so-called &quot;script kiddies&quot; who cannot even compute the integral of x^2. Unlike <em>real</em> hackers,
            who have to know this because their software depends on this calculation. You will also catch crackers having a serious lack of volabulary, replacing letters with numbers inappropriately such as elite --&gt; l33t. I imagine one would react, &quot;what is
            this blantant mispelling of the English language? A third grader must have wrote this.&quot; You will also catch them saying nonsensical words such as &quot;LOL&quot;, &quot;lmao&quot; and &quot;kek&quot; that average people don&apos;t understand.</p>
          <p className="text-center">So if you ever get to meet any bad hackers, call them <strong>crackers</strong> instead. If they ask why, tell them I said so, let them deal with me ðŸ˜Ž</p>

          <p className="text-center">Well, I heard on the news that some guy distributed malware to everyone&apos;s devices. I also heard on the news about this guy who makes a product that everyone wants to use.</p>

          <h3 className="title text-center">But you don&apos;t have a product.</h3>
