## Ali Sherief's Website

# Under Construction
I'm in the process of creating my website. It should be finished in a few weeks.

### Hey look what I found though...
I though Github pages was just static markdown files. It seems that I can add Javascript, HTML/CSS and posibly other scripting languages such as Ruby. Imagine the possibilities.

This is going to be fun.
